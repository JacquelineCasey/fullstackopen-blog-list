## Exercises

The project is involved in the following exercises:
- 4.1: Expand a given application body into a fully working npm project.
- 4.2: Refactor the project into modules, as we did [here](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part4/structure_of_backend_application_introduction_to_testing#project-structure).
- 4.3: Add a `dummy` function to `utils/list_helper.js`, and setup the testing system.
- 4.4: Write and test `totalLikes()`, which returns the total number of likes in a blog list.
- 4.5: Write and test `favoriteBlog()`, which returns the favorite blog.
  - When comparing objects, `toEqual()` is better than `toBe()`, which only comparse values (address / reference).
- 4.6: Write and test `mostBlogs`. This is a good time to try out the `Lodash` library.
- 4.7: Write and test `mostLikes`.
